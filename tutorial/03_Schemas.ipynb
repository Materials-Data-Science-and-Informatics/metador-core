    "After seeing how schema and field inheritance work and learning how to declare a child schema correctly without violating parent compatibility, now you might wonder what kind of types you can use in your schemas in order to express as precisely as possible what values are supposed to go into which fields. The possibilities, in fact, are limitless and there are many ways to model the same requirement. To get you started and give you an idea, we will give a quick overview of the most common and most useful types, give some guidance on how and when to use them, and equally important - what to avoid.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Primitives, times, dates and pydantic built-in types\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use the corresponding built-in Python types - you may simply use `bool`, `int`, `float` and `str` as annotations (however, you should rarely need them and will probably use *constrained types* which are discussed further below).\n",

    "\n",
    "Furthermore, in `metador_core.schema.types` we provide a number of generally useful types for different purposes which are meant to be imported directly. Take a look at them and prefer reusing or extenting them before you start defining your own types. \n",

    "#### Metador schemas\n",
    "\n",
    "You can always use any other existing Metador schemas when defining a field. In fact, **this should be your preferred and default go-to choice for modelling nested, complex metadata**.

    "#### Optional values\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to declare a field that is relevant, but might not always be available, then you can make it `Optional` (from the `typing` module), so omitting the value will not be an error (in this case, the object will then automatically be `None` for this field).\n",
    "\n",
    "When you define a new field in a schema that you develop on your own, you should **try to stick with mandatory fields as much as possible** in your initial versions, and relax a field to `Optional` only when there is really no feasible way to provide the desired information consistently. This way you will break less potential child schemas that are based on your schema. If a child schema will rely on a field being optional, but you suddenly make it mandatory, the child schema will also have to make it mandatory (otherwise it violates the parent rule discussed above by allowing a \"missing value\", which is `None`, that is not allowed in the parent, that is your schema). Also, obtaining missing information for a schema after-the-fact is harder or even impossible (e.g. you cannot re-do the scientific experiment), so it is better to err on the side of \"strictness\" up-front.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples:** `Optional[int]`, `Optional[SIValue]`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Collections\n",
    "\n",
    "To describe a collection of values or objects of the same kind, you can `List` or `Set` from `typing`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use `List` if you want need to keep duplicate values or if order of the elements matters, otherwise use a `Set`**. Many things where you might first instinctively use a `List` are *actually*, semantically `Set`s, so make sure that you choose one or the other consciously. This choice has actual practical consequences for the behavior of harvesters (that we will talk about in a different tutorial).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples:** `List[float]`, `Set[AnyHttpUrl]`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Literals and Enums\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes you want a field to have a fixed value, or a value from a controlled list. The tools that you can use are `Literal`s (from `typing`) and `Enum`s (from `enum`). The rule of thumb is that you probably should use a simple `Literal` when there is just one or a handful of values that are permitted, but for a longer list you should define an [`Enum` class](https://docs.python.org/3/library/enum.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples:** `Literal[\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"]`, `Literal[0, 42]`, `Literal[\"always_this_value\"]`, `SimAlgorithm`\n",
    "\n",
    "with `SimAlgorithm` e.g. defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class SimAlgorithm(str, Enum):\n",
    "    simple = \"simple-simulation\"\n",
    "    fancy = \"fancy-simulation\"\n",
    "    # ... other supported algorithms\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Constrained types\n",
    "\n",
    "Constrained types are variants of the primitive and collection types that we discussed above, where you want or need to restrict the range of permitted values. Examples are requirements such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "* the number must be positive\n",
    "* the value must be in $[-\\pi, \\pi)$\n",
    "* the string must have a length between 100-1000 characters\n",
    "* the list can have at most 7 elements\n",
    "\n",
    "For constrained types, in Metador schemas we prefer using types based on the [phantom](https://phantom-types.readthedocs.io/en/0.7.1/pages/builtin-types.html) library. The advantage of using `phantom` types is that these work well with schema inheritance and the automatic checks that make sure that your types are compatible with the parent schema, whereas constrained types provided by `pydantic` do not have these nice properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Alternative choices\n",
    "\n",
    "If you must accept values of multiple different types, you can use `Union` (from `typing`).\n",
    "\n",
    "**We strongly advise against modelling your schema with `Union`s** if this can be avoided, there exist certain unintuitive subtleties that can lead to unexpected/unintended behavior. For example, due to how parsing of the metadata by `pydantic` works, when loading a metadata object, a value will always be of the first type (in the order as listed in the `Union`) for which the conversion succeeds. This means that **the order of listed types matters in `Union`s, so always list more specific types before more general types**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Completely avoiding `Union`s could be difficult if your schema is implementing an existing standard where such alternatives (e.g. giving either a number or a string) are supported. So please just be especially careful with `Union`s and when testing your schema, make sure to pay special attention to how fields with `Union` types behave.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### What to avoid\n",
    "\n",
    "**unconstrained numbers and strings:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Avoid \"plain\" `int`, `float` or `str` in your schemas. We used them in the examples to keep it simple, but in actual use cases, there usually are restrictions that should apply - values you actually should exclude because they do not make sense in your context. Always try to formulate a constrained type and only fall back to these primitive types when there is no other solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "One type you might want to use often is the `NonEmptyStr` type. You should always use `Optional[NonEmptyStr]` instead of `str` even if the string is missing. The reason is that an empty string is still a string, it is not considered a missing value, so if an empty string is not something you see as a relevant value, it must be excluded. \n",
    "\n",
    "This kind of discipline might feel unfamiliar to you or look very \"un-Pythonic\", but you will see that it can prevent many avoidable mistakes and removes ambiguity. **Making sure that missing values are represented in an unambiguous way is crucial to make harvesters work correctly**. There already exists a unique, unambiguous value representing missing information in Python, which is `None`, and the way to state that information is missing is wrapping the type of value in `Optional` to allow `None`.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-warning\">\n",
    "    <b>Always make sure to sufficiently constrain your values and allow only actually meaningful ones, make optionality explicit using <tt>Optional</tt>!</b>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tuple:**\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a type hint `Tuple` in `typing` that can be used for tuples, but there are not many cases where a tuple would be the best solution. Instead of a tuple where each component is semantically different or has a different type, such as `Tuple[int, str, bool]`, you should write a schema instead and give those components a name.\n",
    "\n",
    "In cases where you expect a sequence of elements of the same type, you usually want a `List`, possibly with a constraint specifying the minimal/maximal number of items.\n",
    "\n",
    "One defendable case for a `Tuple` would be a vector in a space with fixed dimensions, such as a 2D or 3D vector. For such use cases, assuming that you provide documentation about the meaning (e.g. using `Tuple[float, float]` and documenting that it is supposed to be a `(x,y)` position), this would be fine. Even then, defining a schema with `x: float` and `y: float` could be the better choice, because the meaning is made explicit in the field name and not relying on external documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dict**:\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a type hint `Dict` in `typing`, but you should basically never use it. **Do not use dicts** for modelling, unless you have no information about the possible keys and the types of permitted values for those keys, which is rarely the case. If you have something which looks like a `dict`, you should define another schema and use that instead. Remember that you can freely define schemas which are not registered as plugins and use them as \"bricks\" to build up your larger plugin schema.\n",
    "\n",
    "**dataclasses and other dataclass-like things that are not Metador schemas**:\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many libraries that superficially look like they work the same way or very similarly to Metador schemas, however in general they will not or not fully compatible. So do not use plain `dataclass`es, do not use arbitrary pydantic `BaseModel`-based classes. When you consult pydantic documentation, keep in mind that instead of `BaseModel`, in Metador the top level class that is used is `MetadataSchema`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pydantic constrained types:**\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned above, avoid pydantic constrained types, i.e. types such as `PositiveInt`, `NegativeFloat`, and their general form based on the `conint`, `constr`, etc. helper functions in situations where you expect that some schemas extending your schema will want to override the fields.\n",

    "\n",
    "Each Metador schema represents a structural encoding for objects that belong to some abstract or real-world category we have in our mind - we know what it means, because we can read the documentation and look at the code if needed. To make this information visible to a machine, service, tool that uses your metadata, but does not know anything about Metador, this \"human level metadata\" must be provided to give the metadata meaning - **semantics**. This does not only help machines, but also other people interested in your data and metadata.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of Metador, we mean that a schema is **semantic** if it is aligned and compatible with existing linked-data standards centered around [RDF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Description_Framework), [OWL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Ontology_Language) and [SPARQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPARQL).\n",
    "We assume that you have at least a rough idea about the vision, purpose and existing tooling for the [semantic web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web), and you probably want to know how to connect your schemas to existing vocabularies and ontologies, so that your metadata is interoperable with existing tools, can be unambiguously interpreted, added into a knowledge graph, queried using SPARQL and profit from all the other nice features that the semantic web ecosystem provides.\n",
    "\n",
    "Until now, all the schemas we defined were structured, provided validation of the metadata, but were lacking a formal semantic interpretation, unless they inherited from a schema that already was providing some semantics (at least covering the inherited fields). If your schema represents a type for which a semantic standard already exists, you can easily make your schema fully semantic.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is done by attaching [JSON-LD](https://json-ld.org/) annotations to a schema. The consequence of doing this is that **every serialized object** (as JSON or YAML, etc) **will contain a `@context` and a `@type` field**. These additional fields are \"tacked on\" automatically to each metadata object, and consequently, if you feed *non-semantic* metadata (by hand, or using harvesters) into metador schemas, you will obtain *semantic* metadata on the \"output\", meaning that tools and humans working with Metador containers will be able to make sense of your metadata with much less effort, given that the schemas you use are semantically \"enriched\" with the JSON-LD fields. For this to work, you have to do some preparations first.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 1: Understand the relevant object types in the standard(s) you use\n",
    "\n",
    "A semantic standard such as an OWL ontology will define multiple kinds of entities, properties they can have and interrelationships. Each schema you define should ideally be a representation of one such entity, which is exactly what will be declared as the `@type` for your schema.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 2: Find or define your semantic context\n",
    "\n",
    "**Semantics Beginner:** You will usually find a default context you can use in the documentation of your semantic metadata standard. It will typically be a URL (which points to the context object), such as `https://w3id.org/ro/crate/1.1/context` or can be even as simple as just `https://schema.org`.\n",

This is a property specific to each *instance* of a schema, a concrete metadata object, whereas the `@type` and `@context` are identical for all the instances. In Python/OOP jargon - `@context` and `@type` are class variables (with the special property of being constant values) and are attached using schema decorators, whereas `@id` is an actual instance variable specific to individual objects - just as all the fields you usually define in your schema. Naturally, in Metador schemas we call fields that behave like `@context` and `@type` simply **constant fields**.\n",

Using structured ways to organize the metadata (using Metador schemas, JSON, etc.) instead of using free-form natural language helps a technical system to understand structure, the \"shape\" of your metadata - which is an important step forward. Technical systems can to a lot with data and metadata without any understanding, because the required understanding is provided by humans - the software developers who understand the domain and metadata and write software which uses it. The advantage of adding such semantic \"hints\" might not be obvious, if you are able to understand the field names and read the corresponding documentation. But imagine a schema designed in a language you don't know - could you make sense of a schema like this?"

But once others start using it, you have the responsibility to be careful with the changes you do, avoid changes that will break child schemas based on yours, and in any case, make sure that the severity of changes is reflected in the version of your schema plugin - which has to follow strict [semantic versioning](https://semver.org).\n",
    "\n",
    "If your schema plugin $X$ had version `(MAJOR, MINOR, PATCH)` and you did changes to it directly or indirectly resulting in an updated schema $X'$, you have to update the version of your schema as well.\n",

Some changes do not require any action, but others do. Changes that \"break\" things should be as rare as possible, but of course are sometimes unavoidable. Breaking changes are always annoying, but not necessarily a horrible experience - if managed well, they just require some extra work which usually is straight-forward. Good management of breaking changes in the reason why versioning discipline is important. This includes updating the semantic versioning triple to reflect the change severity (so that machines can see whether a schema and some metadata are compatible), and communication of the changes by other means (to inform users and provide ways to upgrade their existing metadata to the new version of the schema).\n",

    "* Use default `pydantic` types for things like URLs\n",
    "* Use `Optional` when a field is not mandatory, but prefer mandatory fields\n",
    "* Avoid `Union` unless you really need and understand it\n",
    "* Avoid `Tuple` unless the meaning of the components is rather trivial\n",
    "* Avoid `Dict` unless you have no idea what it can contain\n",
