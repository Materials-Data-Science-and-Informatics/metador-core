General purpose functionality and infrastructure for managing Ardiem containers.

# Immutable HDF5 (IH5) records

`IH5Record` is an (almost) drop-in replacement for and wrapper of
[h5py](https://docs.h5py.org/en/latest/index.html) to manage
layered immutable records consisting of a series of patches.
(See [here](./ardiem_container/ih5/PATCH_THEORY.md) for technical details of the design)

When needed, a `IH5Record` can be flattened down into a single file
for applications where the IH5 API cannot be used to inspect the
multi-file records.

# Ardiem-specific IH5 record packing and validation infrastructure

`ArdiemRecord` is based on `IH5Record` and extends it with

* entry-point based plugin system for packaging records from directories
* support for creating patches without having the full latest container locally
* validation of general and plugin-specific data and metadata constraints
* record upload to and download from Invenio RDM through
  [iridium](https://github.com/Materials-Data-Science-and-Informatics/iridium) (**TODO**)

## Getting Started

As a user, you can install this package just as any other package into your current
Python environment using:
```
$ pip install ardiem-container@git+https://github.com/Materials-Data-Science-and-Informatics/ardiem-container.git
```

As usual, it is highly recommended that you use a
[virtual environment](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41573587/what-is-the-difference-between-venv-pyvenv-pyenv-virtualenv-virtualenvwrappe)
to ensure isolation of dependencies between unrelated projects
(or use `poetry` as described further below, which automatically takes care of this).

## Compatibility and Known Issues

This package supports Python `>=3.8`.

There was a mysterious bug when using inside Jupyter `6.4.6`,
but there are no known problems when upgrading to Jupyter `6.4.10`.

If you encounter any problems, ensure that your bug is reproducible in a simple and
minimal standalone Python script that is runnable in a venv with this package installed
and can demonstrate your issue.

## Development

This project uses [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for dependency
management, so you will need to have poetry
[installed](https://python-poetry.org/docs/master/#installing-with-the-official-installer)
in order to contribute.

Then you can run the following lines to setup the project and install the package:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/Materials-Data-Science-and-Informatics/ardiem-container.git
$ cd ardiem-container
$ poetry install
```

Run `pre-commit install` (see [https://pre-commit.com](https://pre-commit.com))
after cloning. This enables pre-commit to enforce the required linting hooks.

Run `pytest` (see [https://docs.pytest.org](https://docs.pytest.org)) before
merging your changes to make sure you did not break anything. To check
coverage, use `pytest --cov`.

To generate local documentation (as the one linked above), run
`pdoc -o docs ardiem_container` (see [https://pdoc.dev](https://pdoc.dev)).
