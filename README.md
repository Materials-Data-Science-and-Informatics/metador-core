Core library of the Metador platform. It provides:

* an interface for managing structured and validated metadata (`MetadorContainer`)
* an API to manage immutable (but still "patchable") HDF5 files (`IH5Record`)
* an extensible entry-points based plugin system defining plugin groups and plugins
* core plugin group interfaces (schemas, packers, widgets, ...)
* general semantically aligned schemas that should be used and extended
* visualization widgets for common data types based on Bokeh and Panel
* generic dashboard presenting (meta)data for which suitable widgets are installed

## Getting Started

This library is not a batteries-included solution, it is intended for people interested in
using and extending the Metador ecosystem and who are willing to write their own plugins
to adapt Metador to their use-case and provide services based on it.

Please check out the tutorials that explain general concepts,
interfaces and specific plugin development topics are provided [here](./tutorial).

For a first taste, you can install this package just as any other package into your
current Python environment using:

<!--
old install link based on https:
metador-core@git+https://github.com/Materials-Data-Science-and-Informatics/metador-core.git
-->

```
$ pip install git+ssh://git@github.com:Materials-Data-Science-and-Informatics/metador-core.git
```

or if you are adding it as a dependency into your poetry project:

```
$ poetry add git+ssh://git@github.com:Materials-Data-Science-and-Informatics/metador-core.git
```

As usual, it is highly recommended that you use a
[virtual environment](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41573587/what-is-the-difference-between-venv-pyvenv-pyenv-virtualenv-virtualenvwrappe)
to ensure isolation of dependencies between unrelated projects.

If you want to write or extend plugins, such as metadata schemas or widgets,
the provided tutorials will get you started.

If you want to contribute to the actual core, see further below.

## Compatibility and Known Issues

This package supports Python `>=3.8`.

There was a mysterious bug when using inside Jupyter `6.4.6`,
but there are no known problems when upgrading to Jupyter `6.4.10`.

If you encounter any problems, ensure that your bug is reproducible in a simple and
minimal standalone Python script that is runnable in a venv with this package installed
and can demonstrate your issue.

## Development

This project uses [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for dependency
management, so you will need to have poetry
[installed](https://python-poetry.org/docs/master/#installing-with-the-official-installer)
in order to contribute.

Then you can run the following lines to setup the project and install the package:
```
$ git clone git@github.com:Materials-Data-Science-and-Informatics/metador-core.git
$ cd metador-core
$ poetry install
```

Run `pre-commit install` (see [https://pre-commit.com](https://pre-commit.com))
after cloning. This enables pre-commit to enforce the required linting hooks.

Run `pytest` (see [https://docs.pytest.org](https://docs.pytest.org)) before
merging your changes to make sure you did not break anything. To check
coverage, use `pytest --cov`.

To generate local documentation (as the one linked above), run
`pdoc -o docs metador_core` (see [https://pdoc.dev](https://pdoc.dev)).
