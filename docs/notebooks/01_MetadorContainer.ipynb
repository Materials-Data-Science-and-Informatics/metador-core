    "## Using MetadorContainer to manage Metadata in HDF5 files\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial is intended for people who already have a basic idea of what Metador is and the value it can provide. Probably now you simply want to jump right in and get started as quickly as possible. These lessons will guide you through the main features and interfaces of the Metador framework step by step and will explain how to perform common tasks which are needed to implement a new use-case or connect a scientific domain to the Metador ecosystem.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Learning Goals:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Understand the main features provided by the `MetadorContainer` interface\n",
    "* Learn to use basic metadata schemas in order to attach metadata objects to data in a container\n",
    "* Learn to discover and access metadata stored in a possibly unknown container\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Making very domain-specific and heterogeneaus research datasets more [FAIR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FAIR_data) is hard. The goal of the Metador platform is to support standardization efforts of domain-specific research data and metadata and make reaping the benefits of these efforts as easy as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "As in most domains high-volume scientific data is numerical, Metador containers are built on top of the well-established and mature [HDF5 format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_Data_Format), which is optimized for this kind of data.\n",
    "Thus, **Metador is essentially built around HDF5 archives of research data where metadata is organized in a certain way**, so that various components of the Metador framework are able to make sense of your data and provide features based on that information. Luckily, you don't need to know most of the technical details to create valid Metador containers with rich metadata - you just have to think about your metadata needs, Metador will do the bookkeeping behind the scenes.\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, if you have used the `h5py` library in Python to archive your data, then you already know almost everything you need to know to create Metador containers. If you have never used `h5py`, please [familiarize yourself with h5py](https://docs.h5py.org/en/latest/quick.html#quick) and come back later, when you have a working understanding of `h5py.File`, `h5py.Group`, `h5py.Dataset` and how to use them to store and access data in HDF5 files.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, assuming that you are familiar with `h5py`, you can think of a Metador container as a special `h5py.File`. Only instead of storing simple key-value pairs as \"metadata\" using `.attrs`, you are enabled to add rich, complex, structured metadata through a new property of `Dataset`s and `Group`s, which is called `.meta`. Note that you still *can* use `.attrs`, if you need to, but the Metador framework will completely ignore them. When you work with Metador containers, it is best to consider `.attrs` as a legacy feature that is to be avoided.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\">\n",
    "    <b>NOTE:</b> As metadata can be attached to both <tt>Group</tt>s and <tt>Dataset</tt>s, for the sake of brevity we refer to both of these simply as <tt>Node</tt>s of the container.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating or Opening a Container\n",
    "\n",
    "To work with Metador containers, you simply can use `MetadorContainer` instead of `h5py.File` whenever you create or open an HDF file.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the first sight, you will notice that a `MetadorContainer` seems to behave like a normal `h5py.File`:"

    "\n",
    "In contrast to other systems that allow you to attach arbitrary key-value pairs as \"metadata\" and call that \"being generic\", Metador provides a generic metadata system that still prioritizes **standards, structure and correctness**.\n",
    "Therefore, all metadata must we valid according to some known **metadata schema**.\n",
    "These schemas are used for automatic validation, i.e. checking that the metadata has the right shape, data types and seems plausible. You simply cannot attach invalid metadata to container nodes.\n",
    "The requirement to have schemas for all metadata is undeniably additional work, but *it is work that pays off - we promise!*\n",
    "\n",
    "As with any kind of standard, **the value of a schema is proportional to the number of its users**.\n",
    "In order to minimize the required extra work and at the same time maximize its value, \n",
    "Metador is designed as an extensible and open framework that encourages the sharing and reuse of various elements, including schemas.  For very general kinds of data, Metador provides metadata schemas that can and should be used or extended. For your domain-specific needs, you will first need to understand your metadata, and then formalize this understanding by using, extending or creating a metadata schema **plugin** (this will be the topic of a different lesson). In this lesson, we will only use the default schemas that are always available to you.\n",

    "#### Interlude: Some Notes on Metadata Serialization and Parsing\n",
    "\n",
    "By now, you have seen all three ways of serializing a metadata object:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `.dict()`, returns a plain Python `dict` containing the metadata\n",
    "* `.json()`, returns a string with a valid JSON encoding of the metadata\n",
    "* `.yaml()`, returns a string with a valid YAML encoding of the metadata\n",
    "\n",
    "When you `print` a metadata object, you will see a pretty-printed `json` serialization.\n",
    "\n",
    "You never have to use the serialization functions explicitly when interfacing with a `MetadorContainer`, but they are helpful for inspecting or extracting metadata stored in a container, i.e. to print it (as we do here) or save a copy of the metadata in a separate file.\n",
    "These are not Metador-specific features, but are provided by the [pydantic](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/usage/models/) library which is the foundation for all Metador schemas. Once you need to write your own schemas, you might want to familiarize yourself with this library.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, observe what happened to the simple `width` and `height` values that we provided when constructing the metadata object:\n",
    "\n",
    "* the values were parsed into objects representing schema.org-compliant `QuantitativeValue`\n",
    "* the values were enriched with the information that they denote pixels (`px`)\n",
    "\n",
    "Such inference is possible in situations when there is a unique correct unit expected by the used schema for some attribute, as we have in this case. This demonstrates how **Metador tries to simplify creation of rich metadata** whenever it can infer some piece of knowledge encoded in the used schema.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now see what happens if we try to assign a value with a wrong unit:"

    "By now, you have seen that you can attach metadata to groups and datasets very much like with the HDF5-native `.attrs`, only that the `.meta` interface is based on schema plugins that provide additional valuable features for complex scientific metadata needs, such as validation and semantic enrichment. In this section, we will look at the remaining features that `MetadorContainer` provides.\n",

    "#### Schema Inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "As **Metador encourages reuse**, it supports **schema inheritance**, i.e. subtyping. A schema plugin can be a specialization of a different, more general schema that we call the **parent schema**. Conversely, each object stored for a more specialized schema can be interpreted as an object of the parent schema, ignoring \"extra stuff\" that make the child schema for specific.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous section, we recommended to attach to each embedded file an object compatible with the `core.file` schema, while in the example we embedded an image attaching metadata based on the `core.imagefile` schema. This works because the `core.imagefile` schema is a specialization, i.e. a child schema based on `core.file`. Let us now understand what exactly this entails:"

As a progressively thinking scientist who cares about FAIRness of their data, you want to re-use existing schemas and standards.

If they care about specifics of your image, they might later consider installing your schema plugin to access all of the information.\n",

    "\n",
    "### TL;DR: Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Opening and Closing Containers\n",
    "\n",
    "* Metador containers are essentially \"special\" HDF5 files\n",
    "* Use the Python `with` syntax to avoid technical problems\n",
    "* Wrap your `h5py.File` objects with `MetadorContainer` and use only the wrapped object\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Attaching and Accessing Metadata\n",
    "\n",
    "* Do not use `.attrs` for storing metadata, unless you have specific reasons (e.g. compliance to another standard)\n",
    "* Do use `.meta` (provided by `MetadorContainer`) to attach metadata to container nodes\n",
    "* Metador metadata is always validated against a metadata schema\n",
    "* Usable metadata schemas (special Python classes) are provided by the Metador plugin system\n",
    "* Metadata is stored and retrieved through objects that are instances of these schemas\n",
    "* You can retrieve a more metadata object as any of its parent schemas (schema inheritance)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Inspecting Metadata Schemas\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use `.Fields` on a schema that you use to get information about expected types and nested schemas\n",
    "* Through `SomeSchema.Fields.fieldX.schemas` you can access nested schemas that might not be exposed as separate plugins\n",
    "* Always use this mechanism instead of trying to `import` these inner schemas\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Using Metadata Standards\n",
    "\n",
    "* The default metadata schemas are designed for compliance with **schema.org** and **ROCrate**\n",
    "* All additional plugin schemas should also strive to reuse existing schemas and semantic standards\n",
    "* For general metadata, try to follow RO-Crate recommentations (e.g. that researchers should be referenced by their ORCID)\n",
    "* General metadata about the whole container should be attached to the container root group\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Searching for Metadata\n",
    "\n",
    "* The container table of contents is accessible with `.metador` and can be used to find interesting (meta)data\n",
    "* Use `.metador.schemas` to see all available metadata types in the container\n",
    "* Use `.metador.query(...)` to iterate through all nodes that have a certain kind of metadata\n",
    "* The `.metador.query(...)` operation also supports schema inheritance"
