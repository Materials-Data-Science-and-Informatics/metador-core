    "In the first tutorial, we mentioned that one core feature of schemas in Metador is that they can be easily **extended** and encouraged you to do so. We discussed metadata for a custom image format as an example. In the following, you will learn everything you need to do this in practice and we will arrive at a reasonable schema by the end of this tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to extend the `core.imagefile` schema to have some format-specific extra fields, so we take that schema as the base class for our schema. Furthermore, at the time we start writing our schema the `core.imagefile` schema is available in a certain version. To make sure that our schema works as expected in the future, we must also state which version of `core.imagefile` we intend our schema to be based on. \n",

The possibilities, in fact, are limitless and there are many ways to model the same requirement. To get you started and give you an idea, we will give a quick overview of the most common and most useful types, give some guidance on how and when to use them, and equally important - what to avoid.\n",

    "For strings, you should use `NonEmptyStr` from `metador_core.schema.types`. It will make sure that only strings that are non-empty and have non-whitespace characters will be accepted - this is what you usually want when requesting a string.\n",
    "\n",
    "For values corresponding to the built-in Python types `bool`, `int`, `float`, you should use the types `Bool`, `Int`, and `Float` in `metador_core.schema.types` (these are essentially aliases for the [Strict types](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/usage/types/#strict-types) provided by pydantic). However, for numeric fields **you should rarely need them** and in many situations will probably use the more precise *constrained types* which are discussed further below.\n",

    "#### Optional values\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to declare a field that is relevant, but might not always be available, use `typing.Optional` in order to make omitting the value possible (if omitted, the value will automatically be `None` for this field).\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\">\n",
    "When you define a new field in a schema, try to <b>keep it mandatory as long as possible</b>.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "Only relax a field to `Optional` when you are sure that there is no feasible way to provide the desired information consistently. **This way you will break less potential child schemas that are based on your schema.** \n",
    "\n",
    "If a child schema will rely on a field being optional, but you suddenly make it mandatory, the child schema will also have to make it mandatory (otherwise it violates the parent rule discussed above by allowing a \"missing value\", which is `None`, that is not allowed in the parent, that is your schema). Also, obtaining missing information for a schema after-the-fact is harder or even impossible (e.g. you cannot re-do the scientific experiment), so it is better to err on the side of \"strictness\" up-front.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples:** `Optional[Int]`, `Optional[SIValue]`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Collections\n",
    "\n",
    "To describe a collection of values or objects of the same kind, you can use `typing.List` or `typing.Set`.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\">\n",
    "    <b>Prefer <tt>Set</tt> over <tt>List</tt></b>, unless you need to keep duplicate values or the order of the items matters.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "Many things where you might first instinctively use a `List` are *actually*, semantically `Set`s, so make sure that you choose one or the other consciously. **This has actual practical consequences for the behavior of harvesters** (that we will talk about in a different tutorial).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples:** `List[Float]`, `Set[AnyHttpUrl]`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Literals and Enums\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes you want a field to have a fixed value, or a value from a controlled list. The tools that you can use are `Literal`s (from `typing`) and `Enum`s (from `enum`). The rule of thumb is that you probably should use a simple `Literal` when there is just one or a handful of values that are permitted, but for a longer list you should define an [Enum class](https://docs.python.org/3/library/enum.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples:** `Literal[\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"]`, `Literal[0, 42]`, `Literal[\"always_this_value\"]`, `SimAlgorithm`\n",
    "\n",
    "with `SimAlgorithm` e.g. defined as:\n",

    "```python\n",
    "class SimAlgorithm(str, Enum):\n",
    "    simple = \"simple-simulation\"\n",
    "    fancy = \"fancy-simulation\"\n",
    "    # ... other supported algorithms\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Constrained types\n",
    "\n",
    "Constrained types are variants of the primitive and collection types that we discussed above with a restricted value range. They can be used to represent requirements such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "* the number must be positive\n",
    "* the value must be in $[-\\pi, \\pi)$\n",
    "* the string must have a length between 100 and 1000 characters\n",
    "* the list can have at most 7 elements\n",
    "\n",
    "For constrained types, in Metador schemas we prefer using types based on the [phantom](https://phantom-types.readthedocs.io/en/0.7.1/pages/builtin-types.html) library. The advantage of using `phantom` types is that these work well with schema inheritance and the automatic checks that make sure that your types are compatible with the parent schema, whereas constrained types provided by `pydantic` do not have these nice properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\">\n",
    "    Prefer using constrained types from the <tt>phantom</tt> library.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### What to avoid\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Alternative choices with `Union`\n",
    "\n",
    "If you must accept values of multiple different types, you can use `typing.Union`.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-warning\">\n",
    "    Do not use <tt>Union</tt> if you can avoid it and make sure you understand how it works in schemas!\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "The first reason to avoid them is that each `Union` forces any tool that wants to use objects following your schema to do a case analysis (*\"if the field is this type, do this, or if that type, do that\"*). While this kind of \"controlled ambiguity\" can be useful, desirable or at least non-problematic in certain situations, in the context of metadata modelling it should be avoided, because it complicates the (re-)use of the metadata (including any transformations and mechanical inspection).\n",
    "\n",
    "The second reason to avoid `Union` is that there exist certain unintuitive subtleties that can lead to unexpected/unintended behavior. For example, due to how parsing of the metadata by `pydantic` works, when loading a metadata object, a value will always be of the first type (in the order as listed in the `Union`) for which the conversion succeeds.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-warning\">\n",
    "    In a <tt>Union</tt>, always list more specific types before more general types.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "Completely avoiding `Union`s could be difficult, e.g. if your schema is implementing an existing standard where such alternatives (\"either a number or a string\") are already allowed. So please just be especially careful with `Union`s and when testing your schema, make sure to pay special attention to how fields with `Union` types behave. At least make sure that you understand how the parsing logic works (see the tutorial on custom parsers) before using `Union`s extensively.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Unconstrained numbers and strings\n",
    "\n",
    "Avoid \"plain\" types such as `Int`, `Float` in your schemas, except in drafting stages of your schema. We used them in the examples to keep it simple, but in actual use cases, **there usually are restrictions that should apply** - values you actually should exclude because they do not make sense in your context. Always try to formulate a constrained type and only fall back to these primitive types when there is no other solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-warning\">\n",
    "    Only use unconstrained types if there are really no additional value constraints that should apply.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "This also applies to strings. For example, above we said that you should use `NonEmptyStr` instead of `Str`. The reason is that even an empty string `\"\"` is still a string, and so is `\"   \"` - it is not considered a missing value, which could lead to unintended consequences down the line. This is an example for a value constraint that seems \"common sense\", but is easy to overlook when defining a schema and can lead to subtle errors down the line.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Making sure that missing values are represented in an unambiguous way is crucial to make harvesters work correctly**. There already exists a unique, unambiguous value representing missing information in Python, which is `None`, and the way to state that information is missing is wrapping the type of value in `Optional` to allow `None`. This kind of discipline might feel unfamiliar to you, but you will see that it can prevent many avoidable mistakes and removes ambiguity - all values that are not `None` are considered to be meaningful values.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-warning\">\n",
    "    <b>Constrain your types to accept only meaningful values</b>!<br />\n",
    "    Optionality is enabled explicitly by <tt>Optional</tt>, and the unique \"missing value\" value is <tt>None</tt>!\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tuple:**\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a type hint `Tuple` in `typing` that can be used for tuples, but there are not many cases where a tuple would be the best solution. Instead of a tuple where each component is semantically different or has a different type, such as `Tuple[int, str, bool]`, you should write a schema instead and give those components a name.\n",
    "In cases where you expect a sequence of elements of the same type, you *usually* want a `List` (possibly with constraints), except when you really have a fixed number of items.\n",
    "\n",
    "One defendable case for a `Tuple` would be a vector in a space with fixed dimensions, such as a 2D or 3D vector. For such use cases, assuming that you provide documentation about the meaning (e.g. using `Tuple[float, float]` and documenting that it is supposed to be a `(x,y)` position), this would be a reasonable definition. Even then, defining a helper schema with `x: float` and `y: float` could be the better choice, because the meaning is made explicit in the field name and thus can be better interpreted without relying on additional documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-warning\">\n",
    "    Only use <tt>Tuple</tt> after carefully considering other options and convincing yourself that a simple tuple is the best option.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dict**:\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a type hint `Dict` in `typing`, but good use cases for it are rare and of technical nature.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-warning\">\n",
    "    <b>Do not use dicts</b> for modelling, unless you have really no information about the possible keys and the types of permitted values for those keys.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have something which looks like a `dict`, you should define another schema encoding all the information about the structure, and use that instead. Remember that you can freely define schemas which are not registered as plugins and use them as pieces for building up your larger, possibly nested plugin schema.\n",
    "\n",
    "**dataclasses and other dataclass-like things that are not Metador schemas**:\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many libraries that superficially look like they work the same way or very similarly to Metador schemas, however they will not be compatible - or worse, they can look as if they work, but will break in specific situations. Specifically,\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-warning\">\n",
    "    Do not use plain <tt>dataclass</tt>es and do not use default pydantic <tt>BaseModel</tt>-based model classes\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "When you consult pydantic documentation, keep in mind that instead of `BaseModel`, in Metador the top level class that is used for our models is `MetadataSchema`.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Pydantic constrained types:**\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-warning\">\n",
    "    Only use the built-in constrained types provided by pydantic, if you cannot see any reasonable use-case where someone would want to tighten the constraint on the field in a derivative schema.\n",
    "</div>\n",

    "This applies to pydantic types such as `PositiveInt`, `NegativeFloat`, and types constructed with the `conint`, `constr`, etc. helper functions.\n",
    "\n",

    "    When you do decide to use pydantic type constraints, <b>you must use <tt>Annotated</tt></b>,\n",

This is the information others will consult when trying to use your schema and helping them to decide whether your schema is useful for their purpose. You should include information that you technically encode into constraint types, if it is not absolutely obvious - you don't have to spell out that a `NonEmptyStr` is a nonempty string, but if `MySpecialParameter` is actually a constrained type representing number range, it should also be explained in the documentation of the field that uses your custom constrained type.

Good management of breaking changes in the reason why versioning discipline is important.

Think of the case that someone extended your schema and added a field with the same name to it which has an incompatible type. Your new field then breaks \"parent compatibility\" for that schema - a breaking change.\n",

Does the parent compatibility actually work, if we try it for concrete instances? All these questions and our expectations about how the schema behaves must be codified into a proper set of tests.

    "This was a long-winded tutorial, if you are here - congratulations! The good news is that now you have a deep understanding of schemas - the most important entity in the Metador system. You will see that most other plugin types are actually simpler! You really earned a break, and some summary notes:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Plugins\n",
    "\n",
    "* Not every schema you define must be a registered plugin, nested schemas can be accessed through the `Fields` interface\n",
    "* Useful schemas that should not be attachable to container nodes can be plugins, but must be marked as `auxiliary`\n",
    "* Auxiliary schemas (e.g. small nested schemas) that are only useful in the scope of your schema should not be plugins\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "* Every schema is either direct subclass of `MetadataSchema` or specializes/extends an existing parent schema\n",
    "* **Parent compatibility:** When extending a schema, you can only add new fields or restrict the values allowed for existing fields\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Type Hints\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use `Optional` when a field can be missing, but for many reasons you should prefer mandatory fields\n",
    "* Use `Literal` types and `Enum` classes for discrete, fixed controlled lists of allowed values\n",
    "* Use classes from the `datetime` package for times and dates\n",
    "* Use classes from the `phantom` package for constrained types, such as number ranges\n",
    "* Use default `pydantic` types for things like URLs\n",
    "* Avoid `pydantic` constrained types, unless in no child schema would want or need to narrow down the constraints\n",
    "* Avoid unconstrained default Python types as hints, unless you really have no special requirements\n",
    "* Avoid `Tuple`, unless the meaning of the components is rather trivial and suitable for a tuple\n",
    "* Avoid `Dict`, unless you have no idea what it can contain and are sure it is the only way\n",
    "* Avoid `Union`, unless you really need it and understand how parsing in schemas / pydantic works\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Versioning\n",
    "\n",
    "* Semantic versioning is to be followed for a responsible management of **breaking changes**\n",
    "* For a schema, any change that will reject objects that would have been accepted before is a breaking change\n",
    "* To minimize breakage, **start with strict schemas** (tight value bounds, mandatory fields) and **relax requirements** in revisions, if necessary\n",
    "* Do not forget implicit changes, such as updating the version of a schema that your schema depends on\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Documentation and Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "* Make sure to provide documentation in the schema and field docstrings to help the users of your schema\n",
    "* Write tests for your schemas\n",
    "\n",
    "<!--\n",
    "* Test both for valid instances as well as invalid instances\n",
    "* Take special care to cover boundary cases when using constrained types\n",
    "* Take special care to cover fields that have advanced normalization\n",
    "* Take special care to cover `Union` fields\n",

    "* All of these are just **Python classes** whose purpose it is mainly to carry around (meta)data in a structured way\n",

    "\n",
    "**Classes, types, sets / instances, values:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* A **Python class** is a complex **data type**, just like the regular data types you know, essentially it is just a fancy `dict`\n",
    "* A **class instance** therefore is just a **value** of that type, so being a **subclass** is the same as being a **subtype**\n",
    "* Each type has a finite or infinite number of possible values, which we will naturally call **value set**\n",
    "* A type is a proper **subtype** if and only if it its value set is a **subset** of the value set of the other type\n",
    "* A subtype is more **constrained** or **narrow** than the original type\n",
    "* A value **is-a** (instance of) a type if and only if it is contained in the value set of that type\n",
    "\n",
    "**Inheritance and subtypes:**\n",
    "* A **subschema** (or **child schema**) is just a **subclass** of an existing **parent** schema, which is its **base class**\n",

    "* **inheritance**, thinking in OOP terms (representing an **is-a** relationship)\n",
    "* **subtyping**, thinking in terms of types and values\n",
    "* **subsets**, thinking in terms of value sets\n",
    "\n",
    "**Composition of schemas and types:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* A **nested schema** is a schema which is used in a field definition of a larger schema\n",
    "* A schema is a **composition** of its fields\n",
    "\n",
    "So you **compose** schemas / classes / types to describe how larger objects are built up from smaller ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "So the following terms are also just different ways of looking at the same thing:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **composition** of classes (**has-a** relationship in OOP terms)\n",
    "* the [**product**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_type) of types\n",
    "* the [**cartesian product**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_product) of the **value sets**\n",
    "\n",
    "Don't worry about the last two interpretations, if they are not familiar to you. These were just listed to complete the picture, but we will stick to calling this relationship either **composition** or **nesting**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here a few concrete examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The number `5` relates to `int` like a metadata object (class instance) relates to its schema (class) (**is-a**)\n",
    "* The type `int` relates to `Union[int, str]` like a child schema relates to its parent schema (**subtype-of**)\n",
    "* The `int` and `str` relate to `Tuple[int, str]` like a nested schema relates to the whole schema (**composition**)\n",
    "* The integers relate to `int` like all valid metadata objects relate to their schema (**value set**)\n",
    "\n",
    "All of this might be a bit confusing at first, but once the connections between these perspectives \"click\", you will be rewarded by a better understanding of data in general, which will also guide you to better schemas.\n",
    "\n",
